# Code Coverage Report - 2026-01-03

## Overview
The current codebase consists of a single source file `src/main.rs`. The core logic for touching files is encapsulated in `touch_file`, which is well-covered by unit tests. However, the command-line interface logic within the `main` function is completely untested.

## Coverage Statistics
*   **Total Executable Lines (approx):** 50
*   **Covered Lines:** ~35
*   **Missed Lines:** ~15
*   **Estimated Coverage:** ~70%

## Uncovered Areas
1.  **`main` function (Lines 41-64):**
    *   Argument parsing logic.
    *   "No arguments" behavior (printing version info).
    *   Help flag handling (`-h`, `-?`).
    *   File iteration loop.
    *   Error reporting and process exit on failure.

## Analysis
The `touch_file` function and `help_message` helper are fully tested. The gap lies entirely in the CLI entry point. To reach >98% coverage, we must refactor `main` to make the CLI logic testable and add tests for the argument parsing and execution flow.
